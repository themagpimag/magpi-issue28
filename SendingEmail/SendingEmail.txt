Raspberry Pi projects can be deployed in remote locations or be running over a long period of time.  In either case, it might not be possible to directly watch the Raspberry Pi for important messages.  E-mail is one solution to this problem, since it can be used to send information updates that summarise the status of a project.  An E-mail can be used as part of an alert system, to signal that something is wrong and action is needed.

Before trying the example programs given below, create a new Gmail account to send the messages.  Another type of account can be used, where the SMTP settings should be modified accordingly.  The program below can be used with the latest Raspbian image, to send emails that contain text messages.  The text message could be created by another program or read from a file.

Simple HTML pages can be sent as the body of an e-mail.  The program below sends an HTML document to a list of addresses and was used to advertise a Raspberry Pi day.  This time, the program has been written using a class that handles the connection to the Gmail server.  Once the connection has been made to the Gmail server, each school is sent an HTML advertisement.  This should be used very sparingly, since Gmail does not permit more than 500 emails to be sent in 24hrs and recipients do not appreciate spam.
