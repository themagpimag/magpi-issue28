Dear headteacher,

<p>
I am writing to you to inform you of the <a href="http://phys.strath.ac.uk/raspberrypiday/">Glasgow Raspberry Pi day</a> at the 
University of Strathclyde</a> [ <a href="http://phys.strath.ac.uk/raspberrypiday/">http://phys.strath.ac.uk/raspberrypiday/</a> ].
This event is being run by a group of 
volunteer IT specialists and experienced lecturers for the 
benefit of the teaching profession and the general public as a 
whole.  We have chosen the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> 
for this event due to 
its versatile nature and potential to develop skills required 
for industrial and research opportunities.

Raspberry Pi day</a> will take place on the 17th of January 2015, 
10am to 4pm, in the Department of Physics, John Anderson 
Building, 107 Rottenrow East, Glasgow.  The aim of the event is 
to encourage computer programming and associated electronics

session in the laboratory.  The agenda for the short talks will 
be finalised during the next two weeks and is expected to include 
introductory material, classroom studies and industry
